                Members of the our Club brought glory to Kuala Lumpur when they won five gold, six silver and six bronze medals at the National Self Defense Championship 2014 in Putrajaya recently.<br /> Led by Chief Instructor Khoo Bu Leong, performed
                outstandingly in the championship.He bagged four gold medals from a recent tournament in Hong Kong, won a gold and silver in the 1st Dan Black Belt category.

                    <br/>
                “After the Hong Kong tournament our students showed tremendous improvement. Those with 1st and 2nd Dan are doing well. However, we’re still lacking in the 3rd and 4th Dan categories,” said Khoo. <br />
                
                The association did equally well in the junior category. The Under-15 sparring event was won by Hong Chun Fei despite sustaining a leg injury. Minister of Youth and Sports, Khairy Jamaluddin was in attendance and supported the participants throughout the tournament.  <br />
                
                The championship was organised by the Minister of Youth and Sports in conjunction with the Putrajaya Youth Festival 2014.

                With the dust settling at this year's National Interschool Competitions, let's have a look back at what we missed out in the Taekwondo competitions.
                <br /> A full array of round house, back hook, back thrust and flying kicks, the National Interschool Taekwondo Championship was an exciting showcase of strategic sparring amongst the young martial artist practitioners.

                <span id="more1">
                <br /> The sports hall was filled with parents, classmates and instructors who lined the edges of the competition field of play, and families and friends looked on from the spectator stands to cheer on the next generation of Taekwondo
                at Toa Payoh Sports Hall.
                <br /> Across Singapore, 235 schools ranging from primary schools to junior colleges took part in the competitions. Over 3500 participants competed in the variety of Taekwondo competitive categories, and audiences got to see a variety
                of synchronised group performances, as well as individual combats. </p>

            <p class="center1">Previous experience has shown that school-based taekwondo training in the Malaysia results in many beneficial effect sregarding school education and the physical health of the adolescent participants; of especial significance, the training

                <span id="more2">
                    plays an important role in terms of exercise value and school-life adaptation.
                    <br /> To explore this overall effect, a self-administered questionnaire was distributed to 401 adolescents over the age of 10 years.
                    
                    The survey comprisesa total of 29 questions that consist of 17 exercise-value-related questions (general,moral, and status) and 12 questions that are related to school-life adaptation (adaptation to teachers, adaptation to academic activities, adaptation to rule compliance, and adaptation to school activities).
                    <br /> The survey results show that taekwondo training affects school-life adaptation by helping to improve student morality and by bolstering the students compliance with school rules during their schooling. The exercise value of taekwondo
                    training is considered a necessity for Malaysia adolescents due to the corresponding educational aspects.
