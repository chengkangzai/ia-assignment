            <div class=" glass ">
                <p class="glass  ">
                    One of the earliest clues of Tae Kwon Do’s existence is a mural painted on the wall of a tomb that was built in the Korean kingdom of Koguryo, between 37 BC and 66 AD. The drawing shows two unarmed figures facing each other in a Tae  Kwon  Do style stance.
                    Additional drawings in the tomb show figures performing blocks and wearing uniforms similar to those used in modern day Tae  Kwon  Do training.
                </p>
                <p class="glass  ">
                    The advancement of Tae  Kwon  Do and its techniques developed as the country of Korea developed. There are examples and history of Tae Kwon Do training in virtually all the records of the different kingdoms that existed within the country throughout the
                    centuries.
                </p>
                <p class="glass  ">
                    The highest form of the ancient art was achieved in the kingdom of Silla. This tiny kingdom constantly faced attacks and opposition from larger and stronger areas. As a result the ruler of the kingdom, King Jin Heung, established an elite group of warriors
                    called the “Hwarang” or “Flower of Youth”.
                </p>
                <p class="glass  ">
                    The Hwarang consisted of the sons of nobles within the kingdom. They were carefully selected and formally trained in all aspects of military skills including unarmed combat, which at the time was known as Tae Kyon. It is significant that the Hwarang were
                    taught not only the importance of developing their bodies, but their minds and spirits as well. In addition to fighting techniques, the young warriors were instructed in history, poetry, and philosophy. The entire body of study was
                    known as Hwarang Do. The Hwarang gained skills not only for battle, but for daily life. This relates directly to modern Tae  Kwon  Do training, which provides self defense skills as well as improved character, self-discipline, and
                    confidence that can be applied to any task.
                </p>
                <p class="glass  ">
                    Following the Silla dynasty came the Koryo dynasty (935 AD – 1352 AD) from which Korea takes its name. Martial arts practice, known as Subak Do, became popular as an organized sport with detailed rules. The royal family sponsored competitions and demonstrations,
                    and martial arts became deeply rooted in Korean culture.
